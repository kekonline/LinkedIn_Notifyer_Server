## About the Project

**LinkedIn Notifyer Server** is a backend application designed to help job seekers by automating job search processes on LinkedIn. It scrapes job listings based on user-defined search terms and sends email notifications about the latest opportunities. This app ensures you never miss relevant job offers and saves time by eliminating the need to constantly check LinkedIn manually.

This project was initially a full-stack (frontend and backend) application but later evolved into a backend-focused project. One of its main purposes was to explore various frameworks and technologies, which you can review in the repository's branches.

## Purpose

The goal of this app is to simplify the job-hunting process by automatically scraping desired job offers and notifying users by email as quickly as possible. It caters to users who want to focus on their search terms while avoiding repetitive manual effort.

## Tech Stacks

This project was implemented with multiple tech stacks, each explored in a separate branch:

1. **Express.js with MongoDB (JavaScript backend)**
2. **Express.js with MongoDB (TypeScript backend)**
3. **NestJS with MongoDB (TypeScript backend)**
4. **Next.js with MongoDB (TypeScript and React full-stack)**
5. **Next.js with GraphQL and MongoDB (TypeScript and React full-stack)**

For scraping, **Puppeteer** is used with advanced techniques to bypass detection and ensure smooth operation.
